How to run the Form Application:

1.  Make sure you have extracted all files from the ZIP into a single folder on your computer.
    It should look like this:
    - my-form-app.exe
    - a 'public' folder
    - (maybe a 'submissions.db' file)

2.  Double-click on 'my-form-app.exe'.
    A black window (console) might appear. This is normal; it means the server is running.
    Do NOT close this black window while you are using the application.

3.  Open your web browser (like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).

4.  In the address bar, type: http://localhost:3000 and press Enter.

5.  The form application should now appear.

To Stop the Application:
- Close the black console window that opened when you started 'my-form-app.exe'.
- Or, close the web browser tab and then close the black console window.

The data you submit will be saved in a file called 'submissions.db' inside this folder.
The list of allowed emails is in 'public/auth.json'.

How to Export Data to Excel:

1.  Make sure you have used the 'my-form-app.exe' and some data has been submitted.
    The submitted data is stored in 'submissions.db'.

2.  Double-click on 'export-submissions.exe'.

3.  A black window (console) will appear and show progress.
    When it's finished, it will say "Data successfully exported to submissions_export.xlsx"
    and "You can close this window now." or prompt you to press Enter.

4.  A new file named 'submissions_export.xlsx' will be created in this same folder.
    You can open this file with Microsoft Excel or any compatible program.

The data you submit via the web form is saved in 'submissions.db'.
The Excel export reads from 'submissions.db'.
